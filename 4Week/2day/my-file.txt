Path Operations
The Path class includes various methods that can be used to obtain information about the path, 
access elements of the path, convert the path to other forms, or extract portions of a path. 
There are also methods for matching the path string and methods for removing redundancies in a path. 
This lesson addresses these Path methods, sometimes called syntactic operations, 
because they operate on the path itself and don't access the file system.
